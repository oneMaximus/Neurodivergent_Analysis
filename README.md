# Neurodivergent_Analysis
NeuroLens aims to bridge communication gaps for neurodiverse users by interpreting non-literal social cues. Using a Raspberry Pi 5, it processes audio and video at the Edge to detect tone and gestures. This ensures sub-200ms latency and 100% data privacy, helping users validate social intent in real-time without cloud risks.
